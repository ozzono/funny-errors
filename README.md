# Funny Error Messages

This package has some funny error messages. The main idea is to work as a suggestion as in the message list below, but it can also be used as a golang package, including some random error messages.
> In case any error is chosen, consider using a comment with the error message to make it easier to find it thru the code later, if needed.
